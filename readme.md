## Aim
The intention for my portfolio was to create a simple yet striking site, that had a unique visual design, and for the content to have a layout informed by the design. As prospective employers or collaborators would hopefully visit my site, I wanted the content to be concise and conversational in tone, to convey a sense of friendliness and openess, and not bog down the visitor with exessive amounts of text-based content, leaving their experience brief and memorable.

## Initial design | Inspiration
From my research into other developer's portfolio sites, a continual issue I kept noticing throughout was design at the  cost of usability and navigation.

The creators would implement certain visual and design flourishes, which, while interesting and novel, ultimately distracted from the user experience. Interestingly enough, the most frequent offenders were UI/UX designers.

These novel design choices brought up an interesting dilemma. How to balance user engagement while still offereing something memorable that sets it apart from the competition, while maintaining a cohesive visual design, flow of content and usability.

From the beginning, I wanted my design to be simple, elegant, aesthetically pleasing, memorable and easy to navigate without overwhelming the user with excessive design elements, novelty and large quantities of text based content.

My approach was to create a site with simple geometric shapes, using a limited colour palette of muted hues and an aesthtically pleasing typography. Visually, I was inspired by constructivism art, russian artist Kazmir Malevich and Japanese minimalism.

Using Pintrest, I collected a library of refrence images that would inform my choices in composition, layout, colour scheme and typography.

After gathering a sufficient amount of reference images, and had a strong direction I wanted to take visually, I began creating my designs in Figma

## Design methodology | Contruction
My approach to building the site was first to prototype each section in Codepen, then, later transfer and combine the working code to Visual Studio Code. As each page/section had a unique design, the 'block by block' approach made the process much easier to conceptualise, and allow me to preview how each section would work together, hopefully minimising future layout issues.

The downside to this approach highlighted a large issue with the design; the need for extensive use of css, and due to the modular nature of construction, made the use of SCSS complex to implement. I could keep track of the various parts of the CSS, but I believe it would be extremely overwhelming to others who may need to view, edit or maintain the code.

As I designed the sections in figma, I wanted them to be thematically linked in a simple fashion. A series of old designs for the landing page featured my name displayed over the top of a large 'N' that was partially situated on the page. I ran with this idea for the later sections using designs that vaguly resembles the letters of my name. The problem with this, I realised later, was that this restricted the way I could display content. I initially thought this wouldn't be much of an issue, as I didn't want the user to have to consume large portions of text, but the inherent issues shortly became apparent after the thought arised that, in the future, I would need to add more content in the form of completed projects. This would require more sections, opposed to a regular site that didn't as clearly differentiate between sections as my site did.

## Challenges
The main challenge for this project comes from the complexity of constructing the various unique designs, implementing responsiveness and uniformality throughout the page. Unfortunately, my abilites as a coder and time available for the project fell short. A simpler design, with less elements and more uniformly arranged content is the direction I should have taken with this project. 

## Future Implementation | To do list
At time of wrting I have tried to incorporate 'Scrollify' a jQuery plugin that allows site scrolling to be customised and alow smooth snaps to sections. As I wanted users to view each section in its entirety, one at a time, and not to experience two halves of two different sectiions, "scrollify" seemed like a perfect solution to that problem.

Other additions I would like to make is to improve overall responsiveness, improve the navigation experience, have the content better formated, and perhaps incorporate some subtle animations throughout the site. In the comming weeks, I intend to start a blog about my coding journey, and will include a link on my site.
